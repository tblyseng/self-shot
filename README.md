# self-shot
This is a capstone project assigned to students with unlimited options to create a web application they choose.

This application adds images from the device camera or local storage to an album in memory.  
Selfies photos can be captured from the media stream from the built-in webcam, or images can be selected 
using a file explorer tool.  Images can be given a title and added to the album.  The album has some functionality including the ability to add, delete, and edit photos.  Images can be filtered by favorites or be searched by title.  

Using WebRTC to access the device camera to capture an image and 
JavaScript to access a local storage directory and create functional album in memory.
